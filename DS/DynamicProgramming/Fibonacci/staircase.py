# Problem Statement#
# Given a stair with â€˜nâ€™ steps, implement a method to count how many possible ways are there to reach the top of the staircase,
# given that, at every step you can either take 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps.

# Example 1:
# Number of stairs (n) : 3
# Number of ways = 4
# Explanation: Following are the four ways we can climb : {1,1,1}, {1,2}, {2,1}, {3}

# Example 2:
# Number of stairs (n) : 4
# Number of ways = 7
# Explanation: Following are the seven ways we can climb : {1,1,1,1}, {1,1,2}, {1,2,1}, {2,1,1},
# {2,2}, {1,3}, {3,1}
